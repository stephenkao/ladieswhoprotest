      The idea is simple.
    </span>
    <span>
      &nbsp;Instead of meeting with friends at a cafe or bar (Ladies Who Lunch),
      we encourage people to meet at a place of protest.
    </span>
    <span>
      &nbsp;Bring your coffee and a sign to Trump Tower, JFK, Town Hall, or a Trump hotel, and catch up there.
    </span>
    <span>
      &nbsp;Why? Because calls to your senator matter, but we also need to make the resistance visible.
    </span>
    <h3>There needs to be a protest every day.</h3>
